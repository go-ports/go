# The Go Programming Language

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple,
reliable, and efficient software.

This repository is a *downstream fork* of https://go.googlesource.com/go

It is intended to support ports that are not (yet?) accepted upstream,
or ports which have been demoted from upstream.

While we do not require that a port pass all tests, there are some rules:

* go-ports is a downstream fork, and superset of, the latest release
* a go-ports port can be promoted to upstream, if it makes sense
* an upstream port can be demoted from upstream but remain in go-ports, assuming a maintainer
* anything on the main go-ports branch has to build
* there is no requirement that all ports pass all tests, though this is encouraged
* ports that do not "just build" will be placed on a branch
* a port unique to go-ports must have a maintainer listed in the MAINTAINERS file
* ports that lose maintainers will be placed on a branch
* our main branch is called 'main'

Unless otherwise noted, the Go source files are distributed under the
BSD-style license found in the LICENSE file.

### Contributing

Go is the work of thousands of contributors. We appreciate your help!

go-ports uses standard github PR workflows; in this it differs from upstream.
That said, to ensure easy code movement, we require that you sign the Go CLA.

Lest there be any question, the Go team supports this project:
"Thanks for setting up go-ports/go. That seems like a great place to coordinate."
